## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

 Generally low level language like assembly language directly provides interface for operations on registers in the CPU for data manipulation and programming, but this will 
 require architectural knowledge of the underlying and also takes a lot of time in development. Where as in a high level language, underlying machine level operations are abstracted
 from the user. C++, Java and Python are the examples of high level languages. Python is called a general purpose language as it is used in broad topics like stand alone application development (GUI),
 network applications( Web development), Scientific computing applications, Machine Learning applications etc.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

In languages like c,c++,java we have specify the type of the variable at compile time. In Java there is leeway we can assign child class object to parent object at run time. 
But either way we have to declare the type at compile time. Where as in python, variable type need not be defined, python variable can be a reference to any data type at any point of tim.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros:
 
	 Easy syntax compared to other languages, 
	 Human Readable, 
	 Easy to code, Hence extensively used in data science field.
 
Cons:

	Compared to c++, Java its very slow, hence not used in computationally heavy tasks. (like scientific computing)
	Since its dynamically typed there might be unexpected errors at run time if errors/exceptions are not handled properly.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

	1) Data Science
	2) Web development 
	3) GUI development
	4) Mobile Application development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

     In python a variable is name that refers to a memory location which can store integers, floating point numbers, 
	points to a list, tuple, dictionary or user defined class object. We can declare using the syntax Ex: a = 5 or b = [1,2,3] or c = 3.2. where a,b,c are variable names.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

	using the command 
	
	variable_name = input()

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

    default datatype of the value taken by the input() is the string (str).

Q8. What is type casting?

	Changing the type of a variable from one type to another type.
	Ex: int(5.8) = 5 ; float("6.8") = 6.8
	
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

	We can take multiple values seperated by some delimited like comma or space and then process the input string later to get different values.

Q10. What are keywords?

	These are some special reserved words by the language and should not be used as variable declaration.
	Ex : for, while,in, print, input, range, int, str,...

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

    No keywords cannot be used as a variable. Doing this will result in syntax error.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

	Indentation in python is used to define the scope of the statements(for,while,if,function definition) unlike the braces used in other languages like c,c++,java.
	After these statments the following related statements are started with a tab space compared to the statements.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

	We can show output in python using print statment

Q14. What are operators in Python?



Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

     / is for floating point division. Whereas // is for integer division. 

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

for i in range(4):
	print("iNeuron",end='')

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Given_number = int(input("please enter the number"))
if((Given_number%2)==0):
	print("Even Number")
else:
	print("Odd Number")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

   and, or, not are the boolean operators in python


Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 Ans: 1

0 and 0 Ans: 0

True and False and True Ans: False 

1 or 0 or 0 Ans: 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

    if, elif, else are the conditional statments in python. These help to execute different snippets of code based on the true/false value of the condition.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

     These are used conditional execution tasks. Ex : To find the max value of x,y,z below code is used
	 
	 if(x>y):
		if(x>z):
			max = x
		else:
			max = z
	elif(y>z):
		max = y
	else:
		max = z

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

     age = int(input("Please enter the age"))
	 if(age>=18):
		print("I can vote")
	else:
		print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

sum_of_even = 0
for num in numbers:
	if((num%2)==0):
		sum_of_even += num
print("sum of even numbers ", sum_of_even)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.


	x = float(input())
	y = float(input())
	z = float(input())
	
	if(x>y):
		if(x>z):
			max = x
		else:
			max = z
	elif(y>z):
		max = y
	else:
		max = z
		
	print("max number is ", max)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

for num in numbers:
	if(num > 500):
		break		
	if(num > 150):
		continue			
	if(num%5)==0):
		print(num)
